# Normalized Compression Distance

Implementation of Normalized Compression Distance described in (https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0312044.pdf)[Clustering by compression], with use of the distance in a clustering example and in order to compute Silhouette score.

## Example
The Jupyter notebook Example.ipynb shows the clustering of MNIST using this distance and the adapted silhouette score.

## Requirements
The code has been developed with python3.7 and the following libraries: lz4. Additionally, sklearn and matplotlib are used in the example.
